            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <h3><span>Trippy</span> is a project completed in just 5 days.</h3>
            <p>The project is led by three IT students, one of which is an Irish student from Dundalk Insitute of Technology, Ireland, and the other two from the MMI Department of IUT in Lens, France.</p>
            <p>Our goal from the beginning is to create a website that helps you to find new interesting cities to visit with your loved ones. And most importantly, we want you to have fun!</p>
